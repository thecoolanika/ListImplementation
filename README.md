# ListImplementation

Overview
This repository contains a set of coding projects focused on fundamental data structures, particularly the implementation of a doubly linked list and an array list in Java. 
These projects serve as building blocks for understanding and working with dynamic data structures.

Projects: 
DoubleNode:
Description: The DoubleNode project lays the foundation for the linked list and array list implementations. 
It provides a flexible and reusable doubly linked node structure that is crucial for constructing dynamic data structures.

MyLinkedList:
Description: This project implements a doubly linked list in Java, utilizing the DoubleNode structure. 
The doubly linked list allows efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions, making it suitable for various applications. 
The project additionally contains an iterator which can traverse through the linked list.

CustomArrayList:
Description: The CustomArrayList project builds upon the DoubleNode structure to create a custom implementation of an array list in Java. 
This array list comes with slight modifications from the standard Java version, offering a unique perspective on dynamic arrays. 
The project also contains an iterator which can traverse through the array list.
